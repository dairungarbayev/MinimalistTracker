# MinimalistTracker

Simple Android app to track productive time in a day.

By toggling a view, the productive time is recorded and accumulated throughout the day. 
If you notice yourself not having your attention on the task, toggle the view to switch to "unproductive" mode.

The motivation was the observation that even in the absence of any overt distractions,
one can still fail to keep the attention on the task at hand by daydreaming, etc.

Ideally would be more usable with a wearable device (a smart watch) to keep it as easy as 
possible to toggle between "productive" and "unproductive" modes and keep the recorded productive time as accurate as possible.
